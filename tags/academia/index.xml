      <description>The pre-print of the presented work can be found on arXiv. The manuscript has also been submitted and should be published in the coming months.
This project was presented at several conferences, including:
 Optimization days, Montréal, May 2018 NSERC Energy Storage Technology Network (NEST-Net) annual meeting, Toronto, June 2018. It was under the network&amp;rsquo;s project Optimal Brokerage Models for the Grid Integration of Energy Storage. JuliaCon, London, August 2018 (poster)  An open-source Julia package has been released here for other researchers to model Time-and-Level-of-Use tariffs.</description>

      <description>So, it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit more than a year since I took a flight to Montréal to start a PhD on mathematical optimization &amp;amp; game theory for smart grids.
After the rush of summer conferences, and my return to France for a part of my PhD at INRIA Lille, it is a good time to take a step back and think of what has been going on and what is coming next.</description>
