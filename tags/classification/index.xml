Part III: Model development
To follow the following article without any trouble, I would recommend to start with the beginning.
How does predictive modeling work Keep the terminology in mind This is important to understand the principles and sub-disciplines of machine learning. We are trying to predict a specific output, our information of interest, which is the category of bank note we observe (genuine or forged). This task is therefore labeled as supervised learning, as opposed to unsupervised learning which consists of finding patterns or groups from data without a priori identification of those groups.</description>

Part II: Feature engineering
What is feature engineering? It could be describe as the transformation of raw data to produce a model input which will have better performance. The features are the new variables created in the process. It is often described as based on domain knowledge and more of an art than of a science. Therefore, it requires a great attention and a more &amp;ldquo;manual&amp;rdquo; process than the rest of data science projects.</description>

      <description>A complete predictive modeling project in Python Part I: Preprocessing and exploratory analysis
One of the amazing things with data science is the ability to tackle complex problems involving hidden parallel phenomena interacting with each other, just from the data they produce.
As an example, we will use data extracted from images of forged and genuine banknotes. The distinction between the two categories would be thought to require a deep domain expertise, which limits the ability to check more than a few banknotes at a time.</description>
